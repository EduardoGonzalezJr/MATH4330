For your project you will need to implement the algorithm from problem 2


You are not allowed to use any built in math functions other than the standard 
scalar operations as covered in class. 


It is not required, but recommended that you write 2 seperate files. 
One should
 be called basicFunctions.py and include all of the subalgorithms you would use
 in your overall algorithm. 
The second should be called leastSquares.py and 
should import your basicFunctions.py file to make use of all of your
 subalgorithms. 


Once written, you must upload your work to a github repo as covered in class. 




Rules:

Your github name must be of the form FirstNameLastName or
FirstNameLastNameM4330, or some similar easily identifiable name. 


You are allowed to work in groups. If you work in a group, you should have only
 one repo. 
Your repo should include a file called "group.txt" which is a list of
 the members of our group. 


The project is due May 8th by 11:59 pm. 


All functions must include a docstring. 
I have included an example below. 



def functionName(arg01, arg02, ....):
  
'''One line description of what your function does


  Quick paragraph about how your function works. 

  
Args:
    arg01: Description of arg01
    
arg02: Description of arg02
    .
    .
    .

  
Returns:
    Explain what the output of your function is.
